This post will give a neither detailed nor comprehensive review on the problem of reconstructing ranking from pairwise comparisons. 

## Problem Setup

Given $n$ items $\{x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n\}$ and an unknown preference matrix $P \in [0,1]^{n\times n}$. The entry $P_{i,j}$ in $P$ denote the probability item $x_i$ will beat item $x_j$.  [@rajkumar2016can]

To formulate this problem as a reasonable ranking problem, we have these two following constrains on matrix $P$:

* For each pair of items $x_i$ and $x_j$, it is rather $x_i$ beats $x_j$ or $x_j$ beats $x_i$, thus $P_{ij} + P_{ji} =1$. (We will also consider $x_i$ ties $x_j$ in some special case.)
* Stochastic transitivity(ST) condition: if $P_{ij} > \frac{1}{2}$ and $P_{jk} > \frac{1}{2}$, then $P_{ik} > \frac{1}{2}$.

## Deterministic tournament $P$
First consider a simply case addressed as deterministic tournament in [@rajkumar2016can]. In this setting, $P_{ij} \in \{0,1, \forall i \neq j$, which is saying that, for a latent ranking function $f(x)$ such that $f(x_i) > f(x_j)$, $x_i$ will always beat $x_j$ in comparisons. This paper[@agarwal2006ranking] studies this setting on graph data and proposes an algorithm with a RKHS interpretation.

### Ranking on Graph Data
Weighted data graph $G=(V,E,w)$, where $w_{ij}$ on edge $e_{ij}$ represents similarity between $v_1$ and $v_n$. We also
